# cSpace

Non-traditional dating app.

This application is designed to break traditional dating app rules by removing the random
display of profiles. Instead users will be able to search through the apps users via a preset
tag system. For example tags such as "looking for love", "Blonde","Nursing Major", etc will
be available. This way people can control their own searches, their own matching, and there
will be no set limit on distance. However, users will be shown profiles nearest them first.
This will eliminate a veil over users eyes that have has previously limited users in their
search for intimacy.

Development Statedgy and Requirements:
cSpace will utilize the MERN stack to create an interactive, simplistic, and professional
space for their users. This means that the app should in theory be fast, quicker development
and overall pleasing to the eye UI, and a stellar UX.

Folder explanations:

node_modules: This folder contains all folders that are related to node. This is not something we
need to change whatsoever.

screens: This folder will hold all screens of the application. IE the login page on initial launch.

assets: This folder holds all imagery, video, etc simply stores things that make the application look pretty.
